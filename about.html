				<h3>About</h3>
				<p>I am an Actor, Director, Creator, Educator, Producer and most recently Web Developer. I go by she/her. I make art in the hopes that audiences will be transported to a different world, and while there be entertained, experience empathy, and be left with questions about being human. My favourite things are funny things, kind things, and interesting things.</p>
				<p>As an actor I have performed all over Canada; in Toronto, at The Magnetic North Festival in Kitchener/Waterloo, Theatre by The Bay in Barrie, in Baddeck, Cape Breton and The Ottawa Fringe.  A play I co-created and produced, <a href="http://www.deadroadsplay.com/">Dead Roads</a> premiered a workshop production at The RISER Project in 2016, and has continued to be developed  at October Oasis at The National Arts Centre and 2016/17/18 company in residence at Factory Theatre. A film I associate produced and starred in, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3503390/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1">9 9 . 7 % </a> was an Official Selection at the Austin Gay and Lesbian Film Festival in 2014.</p>
				<p>I was the Artistic Producer of <a href="http://paprikafestival.com/"></a>The Paprika Festival from 2015-2017; a youth-led theatre festival and year-round training/mentorship program for young artists.  I created the inaugural Acting program at <a href="http://centauriartsacademy.com/">Centauri Arts</a> .  I received OAC funding to co-run a theatre program for students at Heydon Park Secondary School; a school that aims to be the preferred secondary school in Toronto in vocational and experiential learning for female students.  In 2012 I was a facilitator for the inaugural theatre program for <a href="http://www.blueprintforlife.ca/">BluePrints for Life</a>, one of the worlds leading companies using hip-hop as both a community development tool and as a model for alternative education and healing.  In 2014 I finished two internships with <a href="https://www.canadianstage.com/Online/">Canadian Stage</a>: Artistic Intern and the inaugural Dramaturgical Internship. </p>

				<p>I am currently the administrative artistic associate to Ravi Jain. I also won the <a href="https://www.theatreontario.org/programs/grants-scholarships/professional-theatre-training-program.aspx">Professional Theatre Training Program</a>  grant to assistant direct Ravi on Animal Farm at Soulpepper (see my blog posts <a href="http://theatreontario.blogspot.com/2018/02/stories-from-professional-theatre_9.html">here</a>, <a href="http://theatreontario.blogspot.com/2018/03/stories-from-professional-theatre_60.html"> here</a> and <a hhttp://theatreontario.blogspot.com/2018/04/stories-from-professional-theatre.htmlref="http://theatreontario.blogspot.com/2018/04/stories-from-professional-theatre.html">here</a>).</p>
